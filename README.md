# Odin-Project-Recipes
My first project following The Odin Project;s curriculum. A website for recipes.

I started The Odin Project to refresh my understanding of basic git and Linux terminal commands, and build a foundational understanding of HTML. Following
the course I created a basic recipe website using Linux on WSL2, git cli, and VSCode. The HTML basics on display in this project include elements, tags, 
lists, absolute links, relative links, and file structure.
